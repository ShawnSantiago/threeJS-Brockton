# Product Explorer - The Brockton - ThreeJS

For this practice project, I am going to dive into the world of threeJS and create a 3d web experience to explore a product called the Brockton. The Brockton is a luxury cannabis smoking pipe made by Parkdale Brass, and I am excited to bring it to life in a digital format.

My main goal is to create a 3d model of the Brockton that can be rotated and examined from all angles, giving users a comprehensive understanding of its design and features. I plan to use threeJS to create a smooth and seamless experience that will allow users to interact with the Brockton in a way that feels realistic and engaging.

I am excited to explore the world of threeJS and bring the Brockton to life in a way that will allow users to fully appreciate its unique design and features. By creating this 3d web experience, I hope to not only learn more about threeJS but also showcase my skills as a web developer and 3d modeler.
